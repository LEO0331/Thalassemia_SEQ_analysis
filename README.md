# Thalassemia_SEQ_analysis

This repo contains files and codes for analysis of Thalassemia sequencing data generated from Sanger sequencing, in which gene mutation was evaluated. 

## Workflow

1. Performed Quality Control for abi files and trimmed low quality sequences

2. Analyze each sequence based on their sequencing primer

3. Double check the mutation sequence by other software

4. Export the results for further analysis
